					<h3>This year's Charities will be announced soon!</h3><br>
			
					<p>During the course of the next academic year, the charity committee are hoping to make sure Hills Road students are more aware of what charities they are supporting and where their money is going.<br /><br /> The committee also hope to put on bigger and better fundraising events for charity and hope to provide support and encouragement to whoever would like to an arrange a charity event themselves. <br /><br />We would like to raise as much money as we can for our worthwhile charities meanwhile also giving Hills Road students better charity days and events.</p>
