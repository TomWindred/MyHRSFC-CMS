             		<p>If you are taken ill during the day go to the Guidance Office where staff will help you if first aid is needed; checking you can get home; filling in your absence on the register and hearing from you or parent/guardian when you get home. You may use the medical room to rest and recover until you can be collected or if you feel well enough to get yourself home, or return to lessons.</p>

             		<p>If you feel you have given serious consideration to changing your course, you need to speak with your tutor as soon as possible. He/she will probably suggest that you speak to your class teacher, and also to someone in careers (as a course change may affect your choice of career and limit your options later on). Your tutor will discuss the issues with you and take further action as appropriate.

Please note that changing courses is a very big step, and it may not be possible and/or advisable to grant course change requests.</p>

             		<p>If your parents wish you to accompany them on an annual family holiday which can only be taken during term-time, you will need to ask your tutor at least a month in advance. They will give you the Planned Absence Request Form and explain what you need to do. Such arrangements should not be made unless it is completely unavoidable. Parents and students who ignore this reasonable request may be asked to see the Principal.<b> Permission will not be granted to students requesting personal holidays during term-time.</b>
<br><br>
For other planned absences not organised by the College you will also need to use the Planned Absence Request Form.

             		<p>All losses or thefts should be reported to the Guidance Office. Any lost property which is found should be handed into, and claimed from, the Resources Office near the Bursary along the main corridor from main reception.
<br><br>
Students should look after their own property, for which the College can accept no responsibility. Do not leave valuable articles unattended. The Bursary will provide a place of safe-keeping. The Music Department has special arrangements for the safe-keeping of musical instruments. Lockers are available for the storage of personal belongings when using the Sports Centre.

             		<p>The Examinations Office is at the end of the corridor from main reception going up the small staircase in front of you. It is usually open to students at break and lunchtime. The office's telephone number is 01223 278090 and its email address is <a href="mailto:examinations@hillsroad.ac.uk">examinations@hillsroad.ac.uk.</a>
<br><br>
It's important that if you are ill before an examination, or travel problems (or have any other difficulties related to taking the exam) give the exams office a call, (not your tutor) and they will advise you what to do.
<br><br>
If you want to know about re-sits, when to expect your exam results, etc take a look at the Exams Website, accessible from the Exam homepage.
