<br>

<p class="dropcap" id = "b1"><a name = "b1"></a><b>Bicycles:</b> Should be locked securely in the cycle rack located next
to The Rob Wilkinson Building. Access to the cycle rack is via the
cycle path leading from Purbeck Road. Get off your bike on the site
and walk it to and from the racks. If the cycle rack is full, please use
Purbeck Road as an alternative. Both locations are covered by
CCTV. Bicycles are vulnerable to theft, so they should be
postcoded and you are advised not to bring expensive bicycles to
College. It is strongly recommended that all cyclists wear cycle
helmets.<br><br>
<b>It is not permissible to lock bicycles to the railings at the front
of the College along Hills Road. Any bicycles found here will

Place, opposite the College, since parking there is illegal.<br><br>
Generally, the use of private cars to carry students on College
business is not allowed. However, there may be extenuating
circumstances in which it is sensible to use a private car to carry
fellow students, in which case the following rules apply:</p>	
<br>
<img src="img/mono-icons/circleright32.png" width="15" height="15" class="alignleftintext"/>
<p>Students who drive fellow students in their own car are
responsible for ensuring their passengers' safety, that their
vehicle is roadworthy, that they have an appropriate licence and
that insurance cover for carrying the students is in place</p>
<br>
<img src="img/mono-icons/circleright32.png" width="15" height="15" class="alignleftintext"/>
<p>The type of journeys envisaged includes taking fellow students
to sports fixtures or on educational visits. (Any casualties
requiring hospital treatment should be taken to hospital by taxi
or ambulance, not by private vehicle)</p>
<br>
<img src="img/mono-icons/circleright32.png" width="15" height="15" class="alignleftintext"/>
<p>If a student is to transport fellow students in their private
vehicle they must complete and sign a certificate (available in
the Bursary) before the journey can be undertaken</p>

<p class="dropcap" id = "i1"><a name = "i1"></a><b>Independant Learning:</b> Independent learning is a phrase that
you will hear often during your time with us at the College. In a
recent report by leading universities on what they wished that first
year undergraduates could do better, top of their list were the
skills associated with independent learning. This means being a
good manager of your own learning and progress.<br><br>
Like universities, we are convinced that those students who
develop the three Rs of:<br>
<b>Resilience</b> (a willingness to keep trying)<br>
<b>Resourcefulness</b> (a creative and flexible approach to
learning: finding strategies to use when you haven't been directed what to do)<br>
<b>Reflection</b> (a self-awareness that allows you to analyse
your progress and to take responsibility for improving it)<br>
equip themselves most effectively for A level learning challenges.
Through progress reviews, assessment and feedback, tutor
discussions and learning conversations with your teaching staff,
there will be considerable focus on you developing effective
independent learning strategies.</p>	
<br>

<p class="dropcap" id = "i2"><a name = "i2"></a><b>Illness:</b> If you are taken ill during the day go to the Guidance Office

enough to get yourself home or return to lessons.</p>

<p class="dropcap" id = "t3"><a name = "t3"></a><b>Time Management:</b> You are expected to be independent, to
organise your time yourself and to make good use of the Library
and Resources areas. You should aim to do about four hours
independent study per week for each of your AS level courses.
Subject teachers will set essays and various other tasks to
be completed outside lesson time, and there will be additional
reading, research and preparation in all subjects.<Br><br>
Set written work and coursework will be expected by certain
dates and you will have to plan your time carefully to meet the
deadlines. Use the diary section of the Student Planner to help
you with your planning. The transition from GCSE to advanced
level is not an easy one, and you should ask for help if you need
it. Departments hold lunchtime surgeries to help individual
students with problems.</p>
