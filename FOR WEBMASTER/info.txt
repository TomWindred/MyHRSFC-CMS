Instructions by Gareth (garethnunns.com), 2014-2015:
Since no instructions were left for me these are all the things Iâ€™ve done that you will probably want to do:
- Updating the roles
You need to login to the cPanel then go to phpMyAdmin and edit the councillors table
Then add images to them here, with the same filename you inputted before: http://myhrsfc.co.uk/manage/officerPictures.html (using the username myhrsfc and the lowercase password)
- Pages to update:
	/Includes/
		common.php - the getCouncillorRow will probably have a return false in it so loads of errors come up for all the roles
		social.php - update the date along the side
	index.html - add your own message, change the contact links at the bottom, 
	who.html - it's pretty self-explanatory: just add the positions in the committee into $councillorRoles[]
