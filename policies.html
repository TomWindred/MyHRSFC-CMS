					<h2>Making the grants and loans system more efficient</h2>

					<p>We now have a monetary subcommittee who will review all applications for grants and loans. If they are under &pound;100, the committee can choose to award the money with consulting a General Meeting. For applications of over &pound;100, the subcommittee will review the application and decide how much money the applicant should receive. They will then present their plans to the General Meeting, where student representatives will vote as to whether or not they agree with the subcommittee's evaluation. For more info contact Jola</p>

					<h2>NUS A Levels campaign</h2>

					<p>As you may be aware, the structure of A Levels is changing quite dramatically over the next few years. The National Union of Students overall opposes these changes, as does the Student Council. We are currently getting in contact with our local MP, Julian Huppert, to ask him to come and speak at Hills Road about the proposed reforms. For more info contact Alex</p>

					<h2>The Papworth Trust</h2>

					<p>We are supporters of the local charity the Papworth Trust, and raised over &pound;700 for them via our Autumn Event. We plan to raise more money for this excellent charity throughout the rest of the year through cake sales and sponsored activities. For more information about the Trust please <a href="//www.papworthtrust.org.uk">visit their website</a>. To get involved with fundraising please contact Ram</p>

					<h2>Recording of lectures</h2>

					<p>The College puts on many interesting talks and activities at lunchtime and after school, but it is not always possible to attend them all! We plan to set up a system for recording the most popular and important lectures and uploading them to sharepoint so that no one misses out. If you'd like to get involved with this please contact Claudia</p>

					<h2>The Girls's toilets</h2>

					<p>We have worked with the caretakers to get the lock fixed in the girls' toilets. All four of the hand-driers are also now working. Please contact Lucy if you see any more problems around the site</p>

					<h2>Consent Campaign</h2>

					<p>Ellie and Alex have worked together to create a programme raising awareness about sexual consent, which has now been integrated into tutorials for the L6. If you'd like to find out more, please contact Ellie</p>

					<h2>Large Charity Events</h2>

					<p>As a committee, we like to support national charity fundraisers, such as Children in Need and Comic Relief. Ram has already run a successful fundraiser for Stand up to Cancer, during which students were sponsored to stand up for a whole day. We will also hold a cake sale for Children in Need and have big plans for Red Nose Day. If you have any fundraising ideas please let Ram know</p>

					<h2>Events</h2>

					<p>We are working hard to ensure that our social events are inclusive and enjoyable for everyone. We are currently negotiating with the Junction about our Spring Event. Contact George for more info</p>

					<h2>Calculator Exchange</h2>

					<p>We now have a system whereby ex-maths students can sell their old graphical calculators to the Council for &pound;20. We will then sell them on to new L6 students. If you would like to sell/buy a calculator please come to the Council office in the hub or contact Jola.</p>
