Firstly, NUS represents the National Union of Students; aiming to empower students to shape both a quality learning experience and the world around them, supporting influential, democratic and well-resourced students'' unions. Basically, giving you discounts when you display your card, so you''re able to have a better social and economic college life. \r\n\r\nOnce you''ve purchased an NUS card, which you can do online at www.nus.org.uk you''re open to a full list of their discounts, along with online discount codes for websites such as amazon.co.uk and ticketmaster, and their newest and most impressive Spotify discount, which gives you 50% off a premium account; along with their latest competitions, which are quick and easy to do. If you haven''t already purchased a card, which the majority of college hasn''t, all you have to do is go online, make an account, click NUS extra on the drop down menu, and it''s very straightforward from there. The total cost of the card is √Ç¬£12, which will be delivered to the guidance office; normally within a week.\r\n\r\nNUS provides a wide range of discounts in lots of different areas, such as food & drink, fashion, gaming, music, gadgets, mobile and health & beauty. The best discounts for food & drink include: 25% off at Zizzi''s, Domino''s (when you spend √Ç¬£25 or more), Prezzo and Giraffe. 20% off at Frankie & Benny''s, Pizza Hut and Pizza Express, and also, when you buy a McChicken Sandwich or Big Mac, you''re entitled to free medium fries.\r\n\r\nIn terms of fashion, you can for example receive a 25% discount at Bench, 20% at Oasis and Coast, 15% at Claire''s Accessories, Austin Reed and Joules, and then 10% at stores such as Miss Selfridge, Warehouse, New Look, Accessorize, ASOS, House of Frazer, Lipsy, Animal, Office, and La Senza. \r\n\r\nOther discounts on popular shops etcetera include 40% off at Nicky Clarke hair salons, 25% at Odeon Cinemas, 15% at Littlewoods Clearance, 10% at places such as Superdrug, Staples, O''Neill clothing, Craghopper''s travel clothing and 5% off at Game. \r\n\r\nExclusive discounts which I handpicked from the website which I think most students would really benefit from include deals for Cineworld, Dell computers, any student who is considering taking up driving lessons with the AA, upto 90% off some Microsoft products, 65% off at Covent Card Comedy Club; and NUS cardholder have to pay just √Ç¬£5 for TATE Modern/Gallery tickets.\r\n\r\nI feel it''s important to notify students that you''re also able to get discounts at most shops/restaurants/etcetera using just your regular Hills Road student identification card, such as Vans, Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and Bella Italia. All you have to do is ask if they accept student discounts when you''re paying, and then ask which card; NUS of Student Card. It really is that simple; take advantage of it. If you have any questions regarding NUS, feel free to email the NUS Officer, Alex Moor. ', '', 5, 'he National Union of Students at Hills Road Sixth Form College', NULL, 1, 1);
